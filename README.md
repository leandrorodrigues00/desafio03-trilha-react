## 👩‍💻 About the project

- This blog was a project developed  for a RocketSeat Ignite Challenge. <br>
- The idea was to develop an application from the front-end to connecting to Prismic CMS for the publication of posts.
- It also contains the Integration with Prismic's Preview system, where it is possible to see an unpublished post inside the blog, even before it is published.
- Uses Utteranc to add comments to blog posts
